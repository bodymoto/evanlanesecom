My personal website, launched on Github pages in 2023, replacing my previous [interactive-website](https://github.com/boshimoto/interactive-website).<br/>
Powered by Web Components and built with the Lit framework for efficient development.<br/>
Compiled by Babel and bundled with Webpack. Developed with Express/Node.<br/>
I employ a web components architecture, utilizing the shadow DOM & custom HTML rendering.<br/>
CSS grid/flex for a smooth and responsive experience. And added DOM element manipulation to reveal a comical .gif on the about page.
